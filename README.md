This is actually my first mod, hope you like it because i had alot of issues while making this.
I have uploaded this to the steam workshop and i can indeed update it when i please, i will be updating the description/readme here, but if you have the steam version check https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1903525208
because you get automatic updates whenever i update the mod, also its easier for me and its faster too.
