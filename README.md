Adds multiple vaults, drills, duos, spectres, walls, forges, extractors, conveyors, liquids, mech units, mech pads. This is actually my first mod, hope you like it because i had alot of issues while making this. Special thanks: People from the discord server: Violet#5020, simon#8156, wewemaster#8854, Nope.avi#4037, omegaDM#0155, People from the steam community: Tibault, 月之殇. Everyone that reports a bug/unbalanced item will be added to the special thanks list (if you dont want to be added just say 'dont add me on the special thanks list')
I have uploaded this to the steam workshop and i can indeed update it when i please, i will be updating here but its kind of delayed, if you have the steam version check https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1903525208
because you get automatic updates whenever i update the mod, also its easier for me and its faster too.
